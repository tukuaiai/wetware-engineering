## Project Overview

**Project Name**: 永生 (Immortality) / 相空间拓展计划 (Phase Space Expansion)
**Type**: Philosophical Research Framework + Knowledge Repository
**Primary Language**: Chinese (with English translations)
**Status**: Phase 0 - Foundation Building (Active Research)

This is **NOT a traditional software project**. It is a long-term philosophical and scientific research initiative aimed at systematically eliminating three dimensions of human scarcity: time (longevity), cognition (BCI/memory editing), and energy (entropy efficiency).

### Core Philosophy

The project follows strict engineering principles applied to documentation:
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple): Simplicity over complexity
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Implement only current needs
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication
- **SOLID**: Applied to documentation structure and organization

### Three Dimensions of Focus

1. **Time Liberation (⏳)**: Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV) - ΔLE ≥ 1 year/year
2. **Cognitive Liberation (🧠)**: Brain-Computer Interface + Memory Editing - P(realization) ≈ 1
3. **Energy Liberation (⚡)**: Entropy Efficiency + Reversible Computing - η → 1, ΔS → 0

## Build System

### Documentation Build

```bash
# Build all documentation (HTML + PDF)
make all

# Output directory: out/
# - out/report.html
# - out/report.pdf

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Requirements

```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get install pandoc make texlive-xetex  # Linux
brew install pandoc make                        # macOS
```

### Manual Workflow

This project has **no automated testing or CI/CD**. All processes are manual:
1. Edit Markdown files directly
2. Build with `make all` to generate outputs
3. Commit changes following git workflow (see below)

## Git Workflow

### Automated Commit Requirements (CRITICAL)

Per project guidelines in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, **ALL code changes MUST be automatically committed and pushed** in two scenarios:

1. **After Task Completion**: After any development task is successfully completed
   - Code modifications
   - Feature implementation
   - Bug fixes
   - Documentation updates

2. **Before Major Changes**: Before executing any destructive or high-risk modifications
   - Large-scale refactoring
   - Deleting core functionality
   - Experimental changes that may break stability

### Commit Command Format

Use HEREDOC format for all commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Brief description of changes

Detailed explanation:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Stage/environment context

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
git push origin main
```

### Important Notes

- **Repository**: Private GitHub repository at https://github.com/tukuaiai/Phase_Space
- **Branch**: Currently on `main` branch
- **Status**: Clean working directory (as of conversation start)
- **Never skip hooks**: Do not use `--no-verify` or similar flags
- **Never force push**: Especially to main/master branches

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Temporal Tracking

Files include dates for version tracking:
- Format 1: `filename_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `项目全面分析与实施路径_2025_10_17.md`)
- Format 2: `filename_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md` (e.g., `文档体系重构_20251017_1105.md`)

### Language Convention

- **Chinese filenames**: Core documentation written primarily in Chinese
- **English filenames**: When explicitly translated or intended for international audience
- **Bilingual**: Most documents have both Chinese and English versions (e.g., README.md / README.en.md)

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

### Location

`kpi/指标_baseline.yaml`

### Structure

```yaml
longevity:           # Time dimension
  delta_LE_per_year: null       # Yearly life expectancy gain (years/year)
  HALE_over_LE: null            # Healthy life years / Total life years

cognition:           # Cognitive dimension
  bci_bandwidth_bps: null       # BCI read/write bandwidth (bits/sec)
  write_error_rate: null        # Neural write error rate ε
  experience_consistency_kappa: null  # Experience consistency κ

energy:              # Energy dimension
  system_efficiency_eta: null   # System efficiency η
  eroei: null                   # Energy Return On Energy Invested

governance:          # Ethical compliance
  irb_approval_rate: null       # IRB approval rate
  audit_trace_completeness: null  # Audit trail completeness
```

### Current Status

All KPI values are currently `null` (baseline not yet established). This is expected in Phase 0.

## Implementation Roadmap (5 Phases)

From `docs/implementation_roadmap.md`:

| Phase | Timeline | Core Goal | Key Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Phase 0** | 0-6 months | Foundation + Survival Stability | White paper v1.1, stable income |
| **Phase 1** | 6-18 months | Academic Dissemination | Published papers, 1000+ community members |
| **Phase 2** | 18-36 months | Evidence Database Construction | LEV/BCI/Energy databases with 100+ entries each |
| **Phase 3** | 3-5 years | Prototype Validation | At least 1 verifiable prototype |
| **Phase 4** | 5-10 years | Organization Building | Establish "Possibility Lab" |
| **Phase 5** | 10-30 years | Technical Breakthroughs | Substantial progress in at least one dimension |

### Current Phase: Phase 0 (Foundation Building)

## Experience Capture System

### Lessons Learned Directory: `lesson/`

**Trigger Condition**: Any error or problem that is identified and fixed MUST trigger experience capture.

**Process**:
1. Identify and fix the error
2. Create new file: `问题描述_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`
3. Commit to repository
4. Push to ensure knowledge preservation

**File Format**:

```markdown
# Problem Title, Time, Module Location, Architecture Context

---

### Problem Description
(Clear description of error and symptoms)

### Root Cause Analysis
(Deep analysis of core cause, technical bottleneck, or logic defect)

### Solution & Steps
(Detailed record of final solution, specific commands, code adjustments)
```

**Example**: `lesson/文档体系重构_20251017_1105.md` documents the refactoring experience.

---

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Format

- Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Code blocks with language annotation
- Aligned tables for readability
- Valid, accessible links

### Mathematical Notation

Project extensively uses mathematical formalism:

```
Time: Y(t) = ∫₀^∞ W(t)dt, where ΔLE ≥ 1 → lim(t→∞) Y = ∞
Cognition: P(realization) = ∏P(i) → g(E), bandwidth ≥ b bit/s, error ≤ ε
Energy: η → 1, ΔS → 0, approaching Landauer limit
```

### Physical Limits References

Always acknowledge physical boundaries:
- **Bekenstein Bound**: Information capacity upper limit
- **Bremermann Limit**: Computation rate upper limit
- **Landauer Principle**: Thermodynamic cost of information erasure

## Special Notes for Claude Code

### When Editing Documents

- **Never use emojis** unless explicitly requested by user
- **Maintain bilingual parity**: If editing Chinese, consider updating English version
- **Preserve mathematical notation**: LaTeX-style equations are intentional
- **Keep temporal markers**: Don't remove date stamps from filenames
- **Respect formality**: This is academic research, maintain professional tone

### When Analyzing Structure

- This is **documentation-centric**, not code-centric
- "Build" means generating HTML/PDF, not compiling code
- "Testing" means peer review and checklist-based QA
- Focus on **content quality** over technical implementation

### When Committing

- **Always auto-commit** after task completion (per requirements)
- **Always auto-commit** before major destructive changes
- Use HEREDOC format for commit messages
- Include "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footer
- Push to private repository at https://github.com/tukuaiai/Phase_Space

### Understanding Success

Success for this project is measured in:
- Theoretical coherence and academic rigor
- Community building and knowledge dissemination
- Evidence database growth (entries in `data/`)
- Long-term sustainability (30-year horizon thinking)

**NOT** measured in:
- Lines of code written
- Features shipped
- User adoption metrics (it's not a product)
